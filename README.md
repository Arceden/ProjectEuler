# ProjectEuler solutions
This repository is a collection of my own ProjectEuler problem solutions. The main goal of this project is to learn new programming languages or to try out new appoaches to solve a certain problem. That being said, you might notice that some problems are not being solved in the shortest way possible because i might end up creating extra classes to practice the use of OOP in a solution.
